config KPROFILES
	tristate "Kprofiles Kernel Module"
	default y
	help
	  This allows you to regulate in-kernel activities in a profile-oriented manner.
	  It creates a sysfs node which can be used to change profiles via userspace.
	  It provides 4 profile modes: Disabled, Battery, Balanced and Performance.

	  The former can be used to disable/enable or tune kernel activities according
	  to a profile mode. Check the README.md for more information.

	  It's safe to say Y here, as the driver isn't very demanding and is only
	  used when developer uses the exported API functions in an another driver.

	  This option toggles the automated mode changer in Kprofile. When enabled,
	  Kprofiles will utilise the notifier API(s) to transition between presently
	  active mode and battery mode based on the device's screen state. Because
	  of notifier API requirements, it is disabled by default.

	  If unsure, select AUTO_KPROFILES_NONE.
